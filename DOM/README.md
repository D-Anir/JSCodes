What is dom ?
- Document Object Model
- Created by browser when webpage is loaded
- Structurally it's a tree of different eleents showing presidence

Why do we use DOM in the first place ?
- Change or remove HTML/CSS elements
- Change or add CSS styling
- Read or change HTML attributes [src, href, alt, etc.]
- Most Importantly, attach event listeners [like cicking, pressing any key, etc.]

Open up your browser, press F12 and go to console
type -> document 
press Enter
It gives you all the HTML document that the browser is working with.

Document Methods : 
1. document.getElementById('idName')
2. document.getElementByClassName('className')
3. document.getElementByTagName('tagName')
4. document.querySelector('#idName')
5. document.querySelectorAll('.className')


Other Functions:
1. setTimeout(function, milisecond)
2. setInterval(function, milisecond)
3. .innerHTML


My tweaks : 
1. Show the active tab
2. Add links there
3. Gratitute and thank mentors in main README
4. Mention photographer of the photo used in timer
5. Make a barebone basic repo about how to setup
6. Numbering the directories

Special thanks to Net Ninja, totally taken help from there to design and code as of now
