ECMAscript - ES6


Variables ::

var, let, const
We donot need to define the datatype of the variable

Context of JS differs on running the file in browser and terminal.
'window' is a browser only context

// RUN in Browser Console.

var myName = "Soham";
if (myName === myName) { console.log("It's a true statement");}

// Now replace line 2, with the following : 
if (myName === window.myName) { console.log("It's a true statement");}
// OUTPUT : It's a true statement.

// The modified line will not be executed in terminal. As window is a browser only context
